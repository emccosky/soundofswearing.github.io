				<h3>Methodology</h3>
				
				<p>Languages vary in sound and script. Despite using Latin text, Dutch and German “g’s” sound completely different. How does one differentiate between these?</p>
				
				<p>Luckily, the <a href="http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/">International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a> reconciles this difference by providing a standard alphabet of 107 letters, 52 diacritics and four prosodic marks, encompassing every single known language on the planet.</p>

				<p>However, this presents a new challenge on its own: What can be gained by using 163 sounds to analyze languages that may only have 20 different consonant sounds?</p>

				<p>The IPA saves us again. Every sound is categorized by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation">‘manner,’</a> a category for similar methods to create a sound, and the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics/Phonetics#Articulatory_phonetics">‘place,’</a> the general location of obstruction of airflow to create said sound.</p>

				<p>To analyze languages, the manner of each sound was used, as manners are composed of more similar sounds than place.</p>

				<p>There exist 13 manners, but five of those included rarely appear in most Indo-European languages, which compose the majority in the scope of this project. All are included to set a foundation for the future of this project, which may include indigenous languages, which frequently include these non frequent consonants. A list of all the manners and their descriptions can be found at the above link.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, an additional challenge arises when asked to produce a list of vulgarities. What makes something taboo or vulgar? It’s extremely subjective and varies from language to language. However, an alleged employee at Shutterstock published an <a href="https://data.world/wordlists">online data set</a> for words that Shutterstock filters by, making sure bad words don’t show up in the wrong places. These words are defined to be offensive, and composed of words that Shutterstock “[wouldn’t suggest] people look at.” These lists include 26 languages across 10 language families, but this project excluded Arabic, as it was the only language of its language family. For a list of Languages and Language Family used in the project, go <a href="about.html#languages">here</a>.</p>

				<p>With these lists of vulgar words, each word will be broken down to its consonant sounds as listed in its language phonology, ignoring any vowels. Furthermore, each instance of consonant occurrence will be categorized to its manner and tallied. At the end, the individual manner tallies will be totaled and given a percent frequency value (the number of specific occurrences over the total number of sounds).</p>

				<p>Similarly, these vulgarities need to be compared to something from its base language. A random list of fifty words was generated and translated into each language to be analyzed the same way as the vulgarities. These fifty words are sufficient to represent the language average, as the random survey on average contains at least 200 total sounds. Furthermore, we expect a significant change on the sound distributions, reducing the required sample size. The risk of error will increase, but still manageable. Without further research done on the “average sound” of a language, the precise number of words/sounds needed are unknown.</p>

				<p>Finally, these percent frequencies calculated are compiled into three-dimensional bar graphs, with language as the z-axis, manner as the x-axis, and frequency as the y-axis.</p>

				<h3>Concerns</h3>
				
				<p>What are some potential concerns that we have that may skew our data and the conclusions we have made?</p>
				
				<p>Well, first and foremost, none of the members in the group are experts in linguistics or phonology in any of the languages studied. Although we are confident enough to identify a clear majority of sounds in the languages we’ve looked at (as a result of studying each individual language phonology, dialects create strong differences that were not accounted for.</p>

				<p>For example, English does not contain any lateral fricatives, however, it has been noted that there are dialects in the American South that contain these manners. In addition, in Italian, the ‘gli’ sound as seen in ‘figlio’ is pronounced as an approximant. However, in many accents, the ‘gli’ is pronounced as a fricative. Furthermore, words like ‘latter’ in English contain a flap-tap if spoken more colloquially, with the tongue quickly flicking the roof of the mouth, while in many accents and in an older generation, are pronounced with a stop syllable instead.</p>

				<p>In addition, the languages covered have a huge bias towards European languages. This is a result of Shutterstock catering to a majority of its users, but to truly understand the nature of vulgarities in relation to speech, indigenous languages must be considered, especially those that have not been affected as much by globalization.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, vowels were overlooked. This was done intentionally, as we believe consonant sounds have more of an impact on words than the vowels. Consonant sounds are sounds that create turbulence in the air when spoken, showing how there is more force and intention when spoken.</p>

				<p>Overall, our biggest concern is the effect of regional accents and dialects. While our data may be true overall any specific language, that distribution may no longer be true for any region that speaks that language. The only way to remedy this is to take a hands on approach, and study specific dialects in the language, comparing it to the overall averages.</p>
